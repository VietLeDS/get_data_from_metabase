Steps to run metabase
1. Run GUI Metabase
2. Check the Metabase file and export to targeted folder

(1) and (2) run parallelly -> use Threading

Code Structure:
1. Main file: Auto_Metabase - list_run is mutable, all mutable is in one object: RunRequirements
2. Helpers: GUI_helpers, Main_helpers, helpers package (if neccessary)
3. Constants: constants (all in this file)
4. link_metabase.csv (all data about metabase code in a dataframe, use as constants)

Algorithm:
0. Has a class of RunStatus, Run Metabse until all code status in RunStatus is True
Each ReRun the .py manually, RunStatus go back to all False, but after one minute, it can turn to True
because of the Check file in targeted folder
1. GUI Metabase: chrome - NewTab - paste link (manually login in the beginning) - check the DownloadIcon
    - if had, means run successful - click DownloadIcon - click '.csv' to download - Done
    - if timeout - Rerun / continue
2. Check file:
2.1 Check in download folder, if not have '{' in the last row mean download successfully -> export
2.2 Check in targeted folder, if same name as export name -> status = True
-> (1), (2.1), (2.2) is Threading
3. How to Speed up:
3.1 Chạy GUI và Command line song song, use threading
3.2 Giảm thời gian chờ Metabase -> Tách việc chạy metabase và việc download ra
